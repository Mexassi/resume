## RESUME
This is just a new version of my resume.

I developed [this](http://mexassi.github.io/resumeapp) when I was still at uni and i figured It was time for an update.

### Specifications
I decided not to use any kind of css/javascript framework and to keep it as simple as possible. I work with different frameworks on my daily job so I guess I just wanted to show myself that I was still able to master the basic principles of web development.

### Generator
I spent so much time over the past two years on development/maintenance of building systems using gulp that I allowed myself to use a yeoman generator called Webapp to speed up the scaffolding process.

Yeah, I know... this readme file is boring and useless. If you had the perseverance to read it to this point I feel you really deserve at least a thank you, and I hope that this will change your day in a positive way.

Peace.
